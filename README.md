## What is it used for?
Driver Boost Pro is an essential tool for a smooth-running PC. You can perform manual and automatic driver scans, updates, and more using this tool. Let’s go through some things you can achieve with Driver Boost Pro.

- Customize and automate driver scans: Using this tool, you can customize how it scans for drivers in the Settings tab, choosing either Latest First or Stability First, with the latter being the safer option. You can also opt for manual or automatic scans, with manual scans initiated by clicking the San button, while automated scans can be enabled from the Settings tab.

- View scan results: Once you have started the scan, and it stops, you will be presented with the results. The scan results show your PC’s condition by listing the outdated game and device drivers. The drivers will be listed as outdated drivers, faulty drivers, not-installed game drivers, and missing drivers.

- Update and download drivers: Once the scan is complete, and you have viewed the results, you have two options. You can click Update Now to update all the drivers at once, or update the drivers one-by-one by clicking the Update button next to each driver. Once you start the update process, the drivers will begin downloading, and you can pause and resume the process anytime you want.

- Configure how automatic updates work: Driver Booster Pro lets you configure how automatic updates work. First, you can set them to download when the system is idle, and then you will have two options: have the updater only download the updates or have the updater download and install the updates.

- Ignore critical drivers from updating: Sometimes, updating some drivers may cause problems when your system isn’t fully compatible with the drivers. When you notice such issues after a specific driver is updated, you can ignore current updates for that driver or all future updates until a more stable version is available.

- Activate silent mode: Driver Booster Pro has a quiet mode that you can activate to prevent the tool from sending you notifications while you’re working.

- Boost system performance: If your system is lagging when playing games or multitasking, Driver Boost Pro can assist in two ways. The first is through Game Boost, which stops unnecessary programs and frees up system resources for a smoother gaming experience. The other option is System Optimize, which improves overall performance by cleaning junk files, optimizing internet speed, and fixing registry issues.
